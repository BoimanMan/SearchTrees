# SearchTrees
A project on binary and red-black trees for CMPS 261 at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette.
The binary search tree uses a class BSTNode for its nodes. The red-black tree uses RBNode for its nodes. NOTE: The red-black tree is mostly working, but I believe I was never able
to get the delete method to function properly. May come back to it at some point.
